# OpemMP 

OpenMP is a framework helping develop multithread software easier;

## Projects idea

1. A game that calls the project using OpenMP to calculate the points in space; using [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) 
2. Increase the Swarm to use OpenMP to calculate all Swarm cells - Maybe add also more features like a player that can play;
3. Something with the Distributed Cache? Use an OpenMP instance to invalidate, update, persist the data;
